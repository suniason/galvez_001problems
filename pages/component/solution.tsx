                    Information technology gives us easier sharing capablities of facts but it also 
                    makes it easier to spread wrong or false information. To use information technology 
                    against fake news, we can take advantage of the technologically advanced systems.
                    We can create an AI or Machine Learning system that gathers data 
                    from various reliable sources to check the validity of the information. Then the system can run  
                    an algorithm that can help limit the sharing of fake news. This can either be created into an app 
                    or integrated into various platforms such as social media.
                    <br/><br/>
                    To sum up, we can use information technology to to our favor. It is a key driving force in ensuring that 
                    the information we receive and disseminate is reliable and trustworthy and make sure. With it, we can 
                    restrain the spread of false information and create a safer environment.
