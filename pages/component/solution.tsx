                    Information technology gives us easier sharing capablities of reliable information but it also 
                    makes it easier to spread wrong or false information. To fight 
                    against fake news using it, we can create an AI or Machine Learning system that gathers data 
                    from various reliable sources to check the validity of the information. Then the system can run  
                    an algorithm that can help limit the sharing of fake news. This can either be created into an app 
                    or integrated into various platforms such as social media. This
